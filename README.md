## Image Optimization üñºÔ∏è

This site includes automatic image optimization that:

- **Compresses JPEG/PNG images** by 40-70% without visible quality loss
- **Creates WebP versions** for modern browsers (even smaller file sizes)
- **Automatically updates HTML** to use optimized images with WebP fallbacks

### How it works:
1. Add images to `src/` directory
2. Reference them normally in HTML: `<img src="your-image.jpg" alt="...">`
3. During build, images are optimized and moved to `dist/images/`
4. HTML is updated to use optimized versions with WebP fallbacks

### Test optimization locally:
```bash
npm run build:local  # Builds and serves optimized site on localhost:8081
```

### Performance benefits:
- **Faster loading times** - Images are 40-70% smaller
- **Better SEO** - Google prefers fast-loading sites
- **Modern format support** - WebP images for browsers that support them
- **Automatic fallbacks** - JPEG/PNG for older browsers

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Source files (edit these)
  - Add images here (they'll be automatically optimized)
- `dist/` - Built files (auto-generated)
  - `dist/images/` - Optimized images with WebP versions
- `scripts/` - Build optimization scripts
- Push to main ‚Üí auto-deploy via GitHub Actions
